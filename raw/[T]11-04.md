# TCP: retransmission scenarios
- TCP ACL


__TODO__ copy table from TCP ACK

Dont send a an ack for every second
IF everything is ok just wait before the ack
TCP is bidirectionl
if you dont ck, the data wont go
it waits 0.5 ms
	- after taht ir was to send smth
- You have to actually provie feedback occasionaly
- if you are only receviving and are not sending anything in the return chanage
- you can recevie 30 packets continuosly and then an ack must be send
- In normal case, at least 1 to 30
	- qq coisa deste género
	- depedende da velocidade das interfaces e do tamanho dos pacotes
- If a session only goes in one direction, it is not TCP


- Cummulatives ack
	- out of order segments
	- detect a packet missing
	- send double ack
	- if you receive a segment you ack continuosly


## Window package to avoid congestion
- When you are transmitting you have various delays
- How o we manage the variable dealys and the packat losses
	- The timeout varies
	- I dont keep the same timeout everytime
	- Or the transmission window varies
	- THe timeout that you send was to be larger
	- Routnrop time 
		- you need to have an idea of the roundtrip time 
		- tou cannot set a timeout without roudntrip time
	- But you dont know the roundtrip time
		- the roundtrip delay varies
			- beteen varios connections
			- in the same connection along time


## Fast retransmission mechanism
- If we have a timeout period which is long there will be a delay in recoverring errors
- the tomeout existes form when the packages are lost
- I have a long timeout
- during that long timeout I send multiple packets
	- If i only lose one of them
	- the rx send a dulicated timeout
	- I simply send the packet very fast without sending the timeout
	- In reality it will get 3 ACK
		- I ack
		- I recevived a packet out of order
			- I send two ack of with the packet i want
- Speeds up potential problemas
- Only happens when the network is not too congested
__TODO__ Copy algorithm

IF the ack is waht i ex+ect
I start timer
if the apcket is not waht i expected, I send two ack

A filosofia base do TCp é go back N
Tu queixatse te do 3
O Fast retransmit +e um selective repeat

# TCP Round Trip Time (RTT)
- The fast retransmit is only useful if the network is not to congistionated
- We measure RTT using the return ack
- Everytime we use an ACK we know the RTT form a TCP point of view
- The estimation uses an exponetial basic
- This is a windows
- The window looks like a routrip time

__TODO__ make a script to test the polynomial

# Managing the transmission wondow
- flow control
	- sender won't overflow receiver's buffer by transmitting too much, too fast
- I send the size of my window, the sender only sends the maximum amount of bytes to fill the window
- Se não estiver espaço no bffe
- the routers have buffers in the interfaces
- as the buffers get motre packages the daelyas on the interface increase
- as the routers get full of packets
- they drop packets out
- there is no finroamtion from the network
- i guess the consgestionated of the nertowk by observe the packate lost or the delay
- i dont know if it caused by the netork or the system
- i reason about it


# AIMD
- Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease
- das técnias mais aplicadas me todo o lado
- Receiver window is responsible for flow control
- sender window is the nmber of packets that i can send in burst
- Defines the sisze of the sending windo on the sender
- Everytime transmissing go fats or goes ok
	- 	everytinme i get an ack
	- 	i increase my windo by one MSS (Max segment size)
- If smth goes wrong, i cut by half my window
- 

- Receiver side of a TCP


- I limte the transmission by the size of the congestion window
- rate = Congestion window/ routrip tme
-
- Will varie as time goes by
- A consgestion exists when I receive
	- a timeout
	- 3 repetibve ack
- Slow start
- congetion avoidance


## Slow start
When I start, congwin = 1 MSS

IF i increase by one and start with a lower bitrate, it will take a lot of time
- Use exponetntial increase: $2^N$
- The bitrate will jump very fast
- I push a lot uintl I have a loss
- TO avoid a bang bang behaviour
	- EXponetial rise
	- cut
	- divide by half
	- expotnential grow
	- cut
	- ...
- When reaches a threslhold, goes by one
- There are muliple versions of TCP in the world
- Names of the TPC protocols:
	- Tahoe
	- Vegas
	- Reno
	- New Vegas
	- Mew Reno
- Using Reno we dont start on the threshold, we start on the Threshold
	- Fast recovery
- Dependendo do TCP que estou a usar pode levar muito tempo
- Quando fazem um reload fazem a ligação TCP
- Teve muitas perdas
- vai linear
- Os algoritmos em cada um dos TCPs é ligeiramente diferente
	- Existem defiferente numeros e diferentes parametros
- Existe uma política de fairness
	- hability to operate in such a wya that bandiwth is evenly shared
	- many small details that globally, using one TCP makes that TCP better or worse 
- The last time there was a timeout

__TODO__ Copiar TCP window variation (slide 66)

With the ACK and packet losses you keep a stable window

__TODO__ Copy slides from TCP protocols

# Shared Queuesand 

- The TDP throttles
- On UDP bitrate will keep on improving


TCP will adjust and suffer the impact of the note
Uso de milhões de TCP na ee ao mesmo tempo vai ter um impacto negativo na performance
UDP will will note
