# Circuit Swiching
- mostrly know by the pjone network
	- end office
	- long distance offsite
	- connecing trunk
	- intecities trunk
- Internet service providers
- In terms of rouing is verybsimilar to everything we have talked until lnow
- in IP is a control task
- in telephone is a management task
- differnent
	- management is smth that you change occasionally
		- happens occasionaly
	- control: basic activity that you have to do regulartly in order to oepratr normaly
		- is always happenning
- Link state
	- no topology change
	- continuous action going on
	- control
- Routing is usually defined because someone looked at the topology 
	- a very centralizaed 
	- the calculation is ditributed
	- the decision is centralizaed
	- the resultas re all equal
	- its really a central machine thta drops the routes to the switches
	- the swivhs are not infomed by controlling
		- 	the managing system takes care of chooseing the routes


## What is the algortihm of a router 
- Topology thin
- Based o Djisksta
	- variant
- Central manageme tm system
	- The gods view
	- it knows evertytihn
	- can create what kind opolicies you want
		- morning goes through France
		- afternoon..
		- etc


Since this is a management action all isues realted to roting protcolos doest exist
The information about tehb etowok is provided by the management sustem
There are no real routing protocols
The routers/switch dont communcate betwwen them to sahre roting inofmration

# Teste
existem 3 componentes de moduelso matematicos
umas ficavam de um lado do teste e outras para outro
nova matéria: routers

Hoje e amnha é TCP

A parte de modualão matemática ira para as aulas seguintes
Vamos faalar do comprimento legal de serviço
Aplicações e outras coisas

Core base de TCP-IP é o que sai para o teste

# Protocolos de Trabsporte TCP e UDP
- COmeçamos pela physical layer
- depois IP layer
- Agora transport network
- Tudo acima da rede de transporte é apliccaitpmn


## Transport servi and potoyocols
- Transport system does not run on the routers
- reun end to ened
- the fisrt thing to establish a coneection end to end
	- until knwo the protocols only address the intermidaitat poitns of the network
- Break file s into sections
	- push to network layer
	- on the other side the segments are rebuild
- The first logical end to end communcaition


Transport servioces

1. TCP and UDP
	- UDP: an extenison of the network
		- the errors of the network are the same in the protocol
		- a best effort connection
	- TCP
		- garantee delivery
		- not garanteed how long it takes
		- not garanteed the BW
		- Reliabile order of delivery packets is not a quality of service metric
			- but influenciate it
		- reliable orde delivery end to end

# PORTs
ports are compomentes of networks
I have a packet that I received
The packet is multiplexed as a UDP or TCP packet
There is a port to use
I need to know the protocol, an then the port

- LBB port


The transport layer provides application to application port
I need to address transport protocols
Its TCP what?
- bitorrent
- skype
- https
- youtube
- etc


The objective of the port is to identify the application taht it is using the application
Multiplexing/Demultiplexing time

USes as socket

- B.S.D: Berkley Software Distribution
- CP/M is the father of DOS
- BSD sockets exist  to create a socket that can talk to any other co puters without knowing what is in the end


## TCP packet
- The purpose of the port is to deliver a packet to the process
- The processor grabs the packet from a port and 


- Indenpendentemente da porta uqe estiver, posso 
- The TCP uses the packet 


Well known ports

```
cat /etc/services
```

# UDP
- Existem portas que não são usadas
	- Porto aleatório
	- o quarteto é unico
	- Ou portos didfeern
	- ou ips diferentes


- USer Datagram Protocol
- Checksum no UDP cobre todo o header do UDP
- cobre pedaços que identificam a comunicação dentro dos dados
- Não cobre os dados, só os endereços de sender e receiver


# TCP
- point to point
- reliable, in order, byte stream
- I have support for congestion and flow control
- flow control
	- there is a way for the sender and destination to agree on the speed of the communication
	- not the physical line speed
	- The end to end communication
	- the application on the server and the application on the receviver
	- end to end transmit speed
	- MTU is defined by the 
	- IPv6 uses a probing mecanism
		- search for MTU
	- IPv4
		- the routers will perform segmentation
		- The MTU will the MTU of the sender or receiver
		- differnet routes for server to computer
			- even if the MTU changes by the connection in the middles
			- the packet size will always be the same in the end
		- There are routers in the middle that will break the packets
		-
- TCP works bidirectionally
	- needs to connection
- THe MSS is and indication to the operation system to know the size of the information taht is passing to the netwotk
	- specific to this machines, this i terface and this opeartiva system
- Connnected ortiented implies setuo protocol


__TODO__ COpy header fields

- IP is best offert but TCP/P provides reliable delivery
- TCP oferece positive acknowledgment c/retransmission
- every time you start a message, you 


the sequence number is not used for numbering
São nomedos os bytes

- O snúmero são cumulativos
- FI there is an ack and is lost
- follows the idea o f go back N


## Poblemas
You start the timer

__TODO__ Copiar imagem TCP sender and receiver

- Nova comunicação
- COmeçar o o SYN
- Start with the sequence number that you want
- All of them nknwo which to receive after
- Finnish the connection
	- Send FIN
- Nomal packet with those bits set
- Terminar implica efetuar um flush de todos os dados no buffer de receção para a apliacação

# Flow control
- At thois koment, the receiver knwo s that all tha packes are transmission
- The TCP skacets recevices the data, process it and then send it to the application
- O emissor sabe que tudo foi recebido mas não transmite nada quanto o recetor está cheio e est'a à espaera
- O tamanho variável da janela garante me o controlo da transmissão
- Não pode enviar 2500 de cada vez?
	- O MSS é mil
- É a ferramenta básica que faz com que seja criável


__TODO__ Prestar atenção aos exemplos. É esse tipo de perguntas que vão calhar no exame

__TODO__ Check retransmission scenarios
