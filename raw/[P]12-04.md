# RIP
- A CISCO implementou o protcolo sem `RIP Request`
	- O que faz é enviar uma `RIP response` com metric 16 em vez de metric 1
- Split horizont
	- Otimização
	- EM vez de enviar todo o routers que conhece, envia apenas o que o outro router desconhece

Codes: C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area 
N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2
E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2
i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2
ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route
o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route

110 representa o fator de credibilidade da rede
20 representa o custo

Na tabela de custo está a 10 cada uma
